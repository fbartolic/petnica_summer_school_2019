# Instructions on running the Jupyter notebooks
## Running the notebooks using Binder
You don't need to install anything locally to run Jupter notebooks with Binder, all you need
is a browser and decent wifi. Simply click on the "launch binder" icon on the top of these 
notes. It may take some time to start.

## Running the notebooks locally
If you have prior experience with Jupyter notebooks and Python, you can run the notebooks after
installing the following additional packages:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib rebound 
```
